## 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Configure (2 minutes)

1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item config.example.toml config.toml
   ```

2. Edit `config.toml` - **minimum required changes**:
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "yourproject"
   locations = ["eastus", "westus2", "westeurope"]

   [admin]
   emails = ["your.email@company.com"]
   ```

3. That's it! The deployment will automatically:
   - Resolve your email to Azure AD Object ID
   - Test each region in order
   - Select the first one that supports all services
   - Deploy everything with proper permissions

### Step 2: Deploy (3 minutes)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
```

**Linux/Mac (Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

**Watch the magic happen:**
```

## Region Fallback Feature 🌍

### How It Works

The deployment automatically:
1. **Tests each region** in your `locations` array (left to right)
2. **Checks availability** of enabled services
3. **Selects the first** region that supports everything
4. **Deploys there** with no manual intervention

### Recommended Region Sets

**North America (Best for US clients):**
```toml
locations = ["eastus", "westus2", "southcentralus", "centralus"]
```

**Europe (Best for EU clients):**
```toml
locations = ["westeurope", "northeurope", "uksouth", "francecentral"]
```

**Global (Maximum redundancy):**
```toml
locations = ["eastus", "westus2", "westeurope", "southeastasia", "australiaeast"]
```

## Key Features Explained

### SQL Password in Key Vault
SQL admin password is **automatically generated** and stored in Key Vault:
- Secret name: `sql-admin-password`
- Connection string: `sql-connection-string`

No need to manage passwords manually!

### Private DNS Zone VNet Links
When VNet is enabled, all private DNS zones are automatically linked to the VNet:
- Enables proper name resolution for private endpoints
- No manual DNS configuration needed
- Supports all services (OpenAI, Cosmos DB, SQL, Storage, etc.)

### Content Filtering for OpenAI
Configure responsible AI content filters:
```toml
[services.openai]
contentFilterPolicy = "default"  # or custom policy name
deployments = [
    { name = "gpt-4", model = "gpt-4", version = "2024-05-13", capacity = 10, raiPolicyName = "custom-filter" }
]
```

### Cosmos DB Data Plane RBAC
Cosmos DB uses its own SQL Role Assignment system (not Azure RBAC) for data plane access:
- Proper data contributor role assigned to managed identity
- Admin users get both control plane AND data plane access

---

## Verify Deployment

1. **Azure Portal**: Navigate to your resource group
2. **Check Services**: All enabled services should show "Running"
3. **Verify Secrets**: Check Key Vault for SQL password
4. **Test DNS**: Private endpoints should resolve correctly
5. **View Logs**: Check Log Analytics for activity

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test OpenAI

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from openai import AzureOpenAI

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
endpoint = "YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"  # From deployment outputs

client = AzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,
    api_version="2024-02-01",
    azure_ad_token_provider=lambda: credential.get_token(
        "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
    ).token
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 2. Get SQL Password from Key Vault

```bash
az keyvault secret show \
  --vault-name <YOUR_KV_NAME> \
  --name sql-admin-password \
  --query value -o tsv
```

### 3. Deploy Your Container

```bash
# Build and push
az acr build \
  --registry <YOUR_ACR_NAME> \
  --image myapp:v1 \
  .

# Deploy to Container Apps
az containerapp create \
  --name myapp \
  --resource-group <YOUR_RG_NAME> \
  --environment <YOUR_CONTAINERAPP_ENV> \
  --image <YOUR_ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/myapp:v1 \
  --target-port 80
```

## Troubleshooting

### All Regions Fail
If you see:
```
✗ None of the specified regions support all required services!
```

**Solutions:**
1. Add more regions to your config
2. Disable services you don't need
3. Check [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)

### Admin Email Not Found
```
✗ User not found in Azure AD: user@company.com
```

**Solution**: Ensure the email is a valid Azure AD user principal name (UPN)

### Permission Denied
Ensure you have:
- Contributor role on subscription
- User Access Administrator role (for RBAC)

### Private Endpoint DNS Issues
If private endpoints aren't resolving:
1. Verify VNet is enabled in config
2. Check that DNS zone VNet links exist
3. Restart your client/VM to refresh DNS cache

## Clean Up

Delete everything:
```bash
az group delete --name <YOUR_RG_NAME> --yes --no-wait
```

⚠️ **Warning**: This is permanent and deletes all data!

**Ready to deploy?** Just run `.\deploy.ps1` (Windows) or `./deploy.sh` (Linux/Mac) and you're live in 30 minutes! 🚀

The automatic region fallback ensures you'll never fail due to regional service availability. Just specify your preferred regions and let the deployment handle the rest!
